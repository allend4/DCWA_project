Log of issues

all data reads from MySql and MongoDB - all can be read in through geth methods.

MySql
- edit and view details didnt go to plan.
i can call the data for each indiviual object in the table, although was unable to populate the form with the information.
- add.
the add functions arent completed. they do work to a point, although the data they pull are Null points.

MongoDB
- add.
add function works. it adds a new head of state.

- Review
Havent done alot of work with expressjs and accessing Mysql and MongoDB.
Found very difficult to put it all into play.
Some examples were given through lectures but found it very difficult to work out Mysql add, edit methods as had no previous work to guide me.
